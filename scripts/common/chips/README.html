<h2>Hit2Gap data transfer with Strathclyde University and associated activities</h2>

<h4> This document explains how to transfer data from/to Hit2Gap portal and associated activities. It assumes access to a bash or similar shell with python3 installed. Source files may be obtained from <pre>I/ESRU/Root/Projects/H2020/HIT2GAP/Linking_to_Nobatek_portal/H2G_linking</pre></h4>
<h4><a href="https://h2g-platform-core.nobatek.com/api/v0/api-docs/redoc">Hit2Gap API</a> can be consulted for complementary information</h4>

<h3 id="toc1">Get data from portal</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Get name of sensor_id (currently by appending NUIG_ or CHA_ to sensor name taken from column <pre>Measure ID</pre> of sheet <pre>Challenger</pre> or <pre>NUIG</pre> of file <pre>I/ESRU/Root/Projects/H2020/HIT2GAP/Linking_to_Nobatek_portal/Challenger.xlsx)</pre></li>
  <li>Write this name in <pre>var2get</pre> along with start and end times of required data acquisition period</li>
  <li>Add the name to <pre>var2get.dictionary</pre> so that the next time you do not have to look in the <pre>xlsx</pre> files</li>
  <li>Delete from <pre>var2get</pre> any previously added sensor names that you do not require data for</li>
  <li>Issue command <pre>./chips -g</pre> to get data for all sensors and times listed in <pre>var2get</pre>. Resulting json files have names as listed in <pre>var2get</pre></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc2">Get curl commands used to get data</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Same as <strong>Get data from portal</strong> section but use <pre>./chips -k</pre></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc3">Upload data to portal</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Get sensor name as described in <strong>Get data from portal</strong> section</li>
  <li>Update variable called <pre>server_path</pre> in <pre>patch.py</pre> to include this name</li>
  <li>Change name of <pre>json</pre> file to be uploaded to <pre>data2upload</pre></li>
  <li>Issue command <pre>python3 patch.py</pre></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc4">Get session cookie</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The PEM certificate issued to Strathclyde University is called <pre>uos_bps.keycrt.pem</pre>. As per advice from Nobatek ssl certificate authentication is active but data cannot be uploaded or downloaded using this protocol. A session can be started with Nobatek server (portal) using this method though.</li>
  <li><pre>./chips</pre> establishes a connection using ssl certificate and gets a session_cookie</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc5">Make ESP-r climate file with data from previous day</h3>
<ol>
<li>For every climate location for which a climate file is required make a file called <pre>location_name.clmvar</pre> where location_name could be any string (e.g. NUIG, Belfast, Glasgow_Airport etc). This file is similar to <pre>var2get</pre> but has only the sensor name in order: diffuse solar, dry bulb temperature, direct solar, wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity. This file informs the scripts which sensors to use for each climate location</li>
<li>Make sure the variables listed in each <pre>*.clmvar</pre> file are also listed in the <pre>var2get</pre> file (do not need to include correct time as this will automatically be changed to the previous day)</li>
<li><pre>./chips -g -p</pre> will get data for all sensors as listed in <pre>var2get</pre> (<pre>-g</pre> = get data) and (<pre>-p</pre> = for previous day, note that -p ignores start and end times listed in <pre>var2get</pre>)</li>
<li>Now create ESP-r ASCII weather files. This command assumes there are one or more <pre>location_name.clmvar</pre> files present which hold sensor names to be used for creating weather files for each location_name. The command used is <pre>python3 mkespclm.py</pre> which creates a <pre>location_name.clm.a</pre> file for each <pre>*.clmvar</pre> file</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc6">Add model to portal</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Edit the file <pre>mk_event.py</pre> to include details of the event (as described in <pre>mk_event.py</pre> and <a href="https://h2g-platform-core.nobatek.com/api/v0/api-docs/redoc#tag/events/paths/~1events~1/post">Hit2Gap API</a>)</li>
  <li><pre>python3 mk_event.py</pre> creates the event</li>
</ol>
